Hello everyone. OSKDDG is an application which was created step by step using Bootstrap, PHP and Laravel framework. 
I wrote a description below, of how to start this application.

1.Run xampp
2.You should create "projectosk" database in PHPMyAdmin
3.Upload this .sql code -> projectosk (3).zip
4.Open the project in PhpStorm / Visual Studio Code etc
5.Write in terminal this command "php artisan serv"
6.You can create a user/instructor/admin using this link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/register, because in the application only the administrator can create a new user. If the administrator put data correctly, the user will get a login and password to the application on the mailbox.

I will be very grateful for every suggestion about my code. Thank you in advance. If you wanna read more about this application or a different one, I put here my portfolio -> https://pgajewski.pl/
