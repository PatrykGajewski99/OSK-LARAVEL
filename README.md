Hello everyone. OSKDDG is application witch was created step by step with using Bootstrap, PHP and Laravel framework. I wrote description below, how to start this application.

1. Run xampp
2. You should create "projectosk" database in phpmyadmin
3. Upload this .sql code -> [projectosk (3).zip](https://github.com/PatrykGajewski99/OSK-LARAVEL/files/8974273/projectosk.3.zip)
4. Open the project in PhpStorm / Visual Studio Code etc
5. Write in terminal this command "php artisan serv"
6. You can creat a user/instructor/admin using this link : http://127.0.0.1:8000/register, because in my application only adinistrator can create a new user. If administrator puted data correctlly, user will get login and password to application on mailbox.

I will be very gratefull for every suggesting about my code. Thank you in advance.
